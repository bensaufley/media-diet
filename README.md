# Media Diet

Data for the media you consume

This app is intended to integrate with services like Goodreads, Trakt.tv, and
the like, along with general-purpose data sources, to build a crowd-sourced
resource for people to investigate their media consumption habits, and see
where they might have blind spots when it comes to the stories they're reading
and watching.

It will use React on top of an Apollo/GraphQL server.
